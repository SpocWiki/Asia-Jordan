> **Petra** (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα "Rock"), 
> originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu (Nabataean: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, Raqēmō), 
> is an ancient city and archaeological site in southern Jordan. 
> 
> Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, 
> Petra is also called the "Rose City" because of the colour of the sandstone 
> from which it is carved. 
> The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
>
> The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, 
> and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, in the 4th century BC. 
> 
> Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom 
> in the second century BC. 
> 
> The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by 
> establishing it as a major regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue. 
> 
> Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts 
> and thus were able to defend their kingdom. 
> They were particularly skillful in agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.
>
> Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, 
> possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas IV, was constructed, 
> and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants. 
> 
> Nabataea fell to the Romans in 106 AD, who annexed and renamed it Arabia Petraea. 
> 
> Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, 
> and after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. 
> 
> In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, 
> but the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, 
> it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. 
> 
> It remained unknown to the western world until 1812, 
> when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.
>
> UNESCO has described Petra as 
> "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage". 
> 
> Petra is a symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. 
> Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists every year.
